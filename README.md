## üìú Project Overview

This project provides a user-friendly dashboard to manage a custom SIP-010 token. It allows users to connect their Stacks wallet, view token details, check their balance, and perform core actions like transferring and minting tokens.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Wallet Integration**: Connect and disconnect seamlessly with a Stacks-compatible wallet (e.g., Leather).
-   **Token Info Display**: View key token metrics such as name, symbol, decimal precision, and total supply.
-   **Balance Checker**: See your current token balance in real-time.
-   **Token Transfers**: Securely send tokens to any other Stacks address.
-   **Token Minting**: Interface for the `mint` function (access may be restricted by the smart contract).
-   **Responsive UI**: Clean and modern interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Dark Mode**: Includes a theme toggle for user preference.
